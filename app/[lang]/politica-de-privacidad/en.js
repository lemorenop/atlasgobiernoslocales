          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, we consider that the processing of personal data is also based on legitimate interest since, for example, the users of our website demonstrate their willingness to obtain our services by browsing our site or by filling out the registration forms or contact, for the sake of a provision of our services in favor of the interested parties.

            CAF will not sell, distribute or lease this information to third parties, except in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Likewise, it is reported that no transfers of personal data will be made, except in those cases in which they are strictly necessary to conduct CAF&apos;s activities and functions, in accordance with the following assumptions.

          <p>
            Prior to carrying out the data transfer, CAF will take the necessary steps to sign the respective Transfer Agreement, through which specific criteria are established for the processing of personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sharing of information described above may involve the transfer of your information to third party organizations or third countries, outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the EEA. The level of protection of information in countries outside the EEA may be less than that offered within the EEA. We will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
